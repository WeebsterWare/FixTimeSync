# FixTimeSync
This code is a C# program that runs a script to synchronize the time on a Windows computer. Specifically, it uses the command-line tool w32tm to synchronize the time. It starts by defining a function "consoleLog" that writes a message to the console with the current time. Then the script enters an infinite loop where it uses the "Process" class to execute the command "w32tm /resync" on the command prompt. The output of this command is captured and checked to see if it contains the message "The command completed successfully.", indicating that the time has been synced. If the output contains this message, the script will log a message and break out of the loop. If it does not, the script will log an error message and sleep for 1000 milliseconds before trying again. It also uses Console.ReadLine() to wait for user input before exiting the program. The purpose of this script is to keep the time on the computer in sync with the time on a time server.
